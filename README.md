) [
  ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot
)

Jest matcher that performs image comparisons using [Blink-diff](https://github.com/yahoo/blink-diff) and behaves just like [Jest snapshots](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html) do! Very useful for browser visual comparison testing.

## Installation:
  ```bash
  npm i --save-dev jest-image-snapshot
  ```

  Please note that `Jest` 20.x.x is a peerDependency. `jest-image-snapshot` will **not** work with anything below jest 20.x.x

## Usage:
1. Extend Jest's `expect`
  ```javascript
    const { toMatchImageSnapshot } = require('jest-image-snapshot');

    expect.extend({ toMatchImageSnapshot });
  ```

2. Use `toMatchImageSnapshot()` in your tests!
  ```javascript
  it('should demonstrate this matcher`s usage', () => {
    ...
    expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot();
  });
```

### Optional configuration:

`toMatchImageSnapshot()` takes an optional options object where you can provide your own [blink-diff configuration parameters](http://yahoo.github.io/blink-diff/#object-usage) and/or a custom snapshot identifier string and/or forcing no styled output for possibly storing the results in a file:

```javascript
  it('should demonstrate this matcher`s usage with a custom blink-diff config', () => {
    ...
    const blinkDiffConfig = { perceptual: true };
    expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot({ 
      customDiffConfig: blinkDiffConfig, 
      customSnapshotIdentifier: 'customSnapshotName', 
      noColors: true // the default is false
    });
  });  
```

Any blink-diff custom configuration can be provided so long as the values for `imageAPath`, `imageA`, `imageBPath`, `imageB`, or `imageOutputPath` are not changed as these are used internally.

By default, we have set [these values](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot/blob/master/src/diff-snapshot.js#L55) for `thresholdType` and `threshold`.

## How it works
  Given an image (should be either a PNGImage instance or a Buffer instance with PNG data) the `toMatchImageSnapshot()` matcher will create a `__image_snapshots__` directory in the directory the test is in and will store the baseline snapshot image there on the first run.

  On subsequent test runs the matcher will compare the image being passed against the stored snapshot.

  To update the stored image snapshot run jest with `--updateSnapshot` or `-u` argument. All this works the same way as [Jest snapshots](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html).

## See it in action
  Typically this matcher is used to for visual tests that run on a browser. For example let's say I finish working on a feature and want to write a test to prevent visual regressions:
  ```javascript
    it('renders correctly', async () => {
      const browser = await launchChromeHeadless();
      await browser.goTo('https://localhost:3000');
      const screenshot = await browser.takeScreenshot();

      expect(screenshot).toMatchImageSnapshot();
    });
  ```

  Then after a few days as I finish adding another feature to my component I notice one of my tests failing!

  <img title="A failing image snapshot test" src="./images/failing-snapshot.gif" width="50%">

  Oh no! I must have introduced a regression! Let's see what the diff looks like to identify what I need to fix:

  <img title="Image diff" src="./images/image-diff.png" width="50%">
  
  And now that I know that I broke the card art I can fix it!
  
  Thanks `jest-image-snapshot`, that broken header would not have looked good in production!
